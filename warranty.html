    <div class="policy form" style="gap:1rem">
      <div>
        <h3>What’s covered</h3>
        <p><strong>12-month Return-to-Base (RTB) warranty</strong> on complete PCs covering parts & labour against defects in normal use. Every system is thermally tested before shipping.</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Parts & labour:</strong> If a component fails under normal use, we repair or replace with same or better spec.</li>
          <li><strong>Proof provided:</strong> We log stress tests (OCCT/3DMark) and can supply results on request.</li>
          <li><strong>Software:</strong> Windows activation and drivers are included; we provide remote help for setup issues.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Change-of-mind returns</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Standard builds:</strong> 14 days from delivery (unused, as-new, all accessories/packaging). Buyer covers return shipping.</li>
          <li><strong>Custom PCs/cases:</strong> No change-of-mind returns (bespoke). Faulty-on-arrival rights still apply.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Faulty on arrival (within 30 days)</h3>
        <p>If something is wrong when you receive it, contact us within <strong>30 days</strong>. We’ll diagnose and arrange repair or replacement per UK consumer law.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>What’s not covered</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Physical damage, liquid damage, incorrect mains power, or damage from shipping due to inadequate re-packaging.</li>
          <li>User modifications outside guidance (e.g., aggressive overclocks, BIOS mods, unsupported part swaps) that cause failure.</li>
          <li>Normal wear (fans, thermal paste), cosmetic marks after use, or software/data loss (always keep backups).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>How to start a warranty claim</h3>
        <ol class="list">
          <li>Email <a href="mailto:bobsbuildsuk@gmail.com">bobsbuildsuk@gmail.com</a> with your order details, description, and photos/video of the issue.</li>
          <li>We’ll run remote diagnostics. If a return is needed, we’ll issue an RMA number and packing guidance.</li>
          <li><strong>Return to base:</strong> You ship the PC to us (insured). We cover outbound shipping back to you after repair/replacement.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="tiny muted">Tip: Keep your original packaging; it’s safest for transit. Remove loose accessories before shipping.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Ownership & transfer</h3>
        <p>The 12-month warranty is tied to the PC and is transferable to a new owner within the original period (please share the original proof of purchase and contact details).</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Your statutory rights</h3>
        <p>This policy is in addition to your rights under UK consumer law. It does not affect those rights.</p>
      </div>
